Converts numbers from 1 to 5000 from decimal integers to roman numerals and vice versa.

This program is incomplete. I exceeded the four hour time limit. 
It can reliably convert from decimal integers to roman numerals, 
but there are still some issues with convertime from roman numeral to decimal.
Given the time, I would resolve these issues.
